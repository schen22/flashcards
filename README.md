Playing around with SwiftUI while helping myself learn Japanese. 

For now: super simple randomizer on list of hiragana and katakana I added myself

Later on ideas to add:
- Add all hiragana/katakana more smartly
- Add audio for pronunciation
- Add ability to self mark right/wrong
- Store what was right/wrong to redo
- Store count of right/wrong to retry 
- stretch: drag and drop to match sounds/characters
- stretch: enable shuffle mode vs cheat sheet to go through a e i o u order
